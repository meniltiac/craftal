        Ian is currently accepting beginner and intermediate students for
        instruction in music production and sound design in
        Ableton Live. He can teach you or your child how to express themselves through
        the infinite potential that the sonic canvas of the modern Digital Audio
        Workstation allows for. From basic audio recording to experimental sound design,
        Ian wants to help you realize your art.
